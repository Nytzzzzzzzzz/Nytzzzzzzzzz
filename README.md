# My Page

Hey everyone! I go by Nytzz, and I'm a game dev, currently learning Python.

I'm most interested in Python for its versatility as a programming language, and it's also really easy to learn.

## My Links

I have a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/Nytzzzzzzzzzz), a [Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/@Nytzzzzzzzzzz), and a [Discord profile](https://example.com/Nytzz@0429) if you want to reach out. Although these do not have anything to do with my Github profile.

## My Projects

As stated previously, I'm a game dev, and I'm working on a big project. The source code is available on one of my repos.
